# end_of_school_countdown

Pure JavaScript countdown to end of school (for teachers, of course :).

This countdowner contains a hard-coded end date, which was fine for my particular use case at the time, 
as I didn't want to have to re-enter the date every time I wanted to check on the days remaining.

After the target date, June 2, 2015, I'll wire up an html input to accept any future date, and that value will become end_date.
Then, the counter can be used for any future date.
