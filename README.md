# end_of_school_countdown
Pure JavaScript countdown to end of school (for teachers, of course :).

This countdowner contains a hard-coded end date, which was fine for my particular use case at the time, 
as I didn't want to have to re-enter the date everytime I wanted to check on the days remaining. 

After the target date, June 2, 2015, I will to wire up an html input to accept any future date, and that value will become end_date.
Then, the counter can be used for any future date.
